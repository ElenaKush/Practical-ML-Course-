In this project, our goal was to predict the manner in which 6 people did the barbell lifts.

We used data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 people, who were asked to perform barbell lifts in 5 different fashions:

exactly according to the specification (class A),

throwing the elbows to the front (class B),

lifting the dumbbell only halfway (class C),

lowering the dumbbell only halfway (class D)

throwing the hips to the front (class E).

In the project we explored data, preprocessed it for modelling, chose an appropriate validation strategy, built several models and evaluated their quality.
